TODO:
* Investigate other databases as the distributed DB is not as "crucial" as speed of access (such as couchdb)
* Clean up generally
* Add more finely grained ACL
* Update master mnesia node from seed node and distribute
* Take a nice long look at the permissions of the chroot environment on the node layer
* Add sample starting environments
* Throw error message when db cannot be created
* Add stats dumping to file
* Remove needless db queries in proxy process
* Throw error for creating duplicate users/apps/bees
* Add job-queue to handle tasks -> queue-driven
* Investigate BERT-RPC
* Force not updating apps after they terminate
* Ensure apps update only on call, not otherwise
* Add automated test scripts to watch processes
* Add more eunit tests
* Add bee_srv to all node types
* Fix race condition with restart/deploy for when a restart is issued when there is a startup going on. Add padding/queue?
