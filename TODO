TODO:
* Add config file for configuration at the command-line
* Investigate other databases as the distributed DB is not as "crucial" as speed of access (such as couchdb)
* Clean up generally
* Add more finely grained ACL
* Update master mnesia node from seed node and distribute
* Take a nice long look at the permissions of the chroot environment on the node layer
* Add sample starting environments
